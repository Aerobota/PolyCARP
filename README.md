PolyCARP 
========

PolyCARP (Algorithms and Software for Computations with Polygons)
is a package of algorithms, implemented in Java, C++, and Python, 
for computing containment,
collision, resolution, and recovery information for polygons. The
intended applications of PolyCARP are related, but not limited, to
safety critical systems in air traffic management.

This repository also the formal specification
of PolyCARP algorithms in the Prototype Verification System ([PVS](http://pvs.csl.sri.com)).

### Documentation

The API document for PolyCARP is still work in progress. In the meantime,
please refer to the release notes and the examples files
`PolycarpExample.java` and `PolycarpExample.cpp`.
